EIDU Technical Challenge (codename: C2)

1. Contents of this package

In addition to this readme file you're supposed to have received five C# source files:
- Promise.cs
- IDownloader.cs
- Downloader.cs
- Class.cs
- TestUtil.cs

2. Nature of the challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to assess your general coding and software engineering skills.

We will
- discuss the given code;
- analyse its behaviour in different scenarios;
- modify it to enhance its functionality.

3. How to prepare for the challenge

You should study the source code carefully and make sure you understand it completely.

4. What this challenge is not

The goal of this challenge is NOT to assess your proficiency in C#, and while fluency in C# might make it a bit smoother, you are not required to be in good command of the C# language, nor to be familiar with the (standard or third-party) libraries the code uses.

NOTE: That said, you DO need to make sure you understand the given code itself, including those features of the C# language the code makes use of.

Compiling and/or running the code is NOT required.

5. Technical environment

When preparing for the challenge feel free to use any IDE and/or other means to study the code.

If doing the challenge remotely, we will use Google Drive to look at and edit the source code together.

If meeting physically, you're welcome to bring your own computer with the IDE of your choice; if you don't, you will work on the interviewer's machine: JetBrains Rider on a MacBook Pro, with a German physical keyboard layout (logical keyboard layout is customisable).
